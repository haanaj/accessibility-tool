Okay, so you've used the tool. You followed the instructions and the guide. Now you got your final score and individual score breakdowns. What exactly does this mean?

## Understanding Your Final Score

| **Score Range** | **What Does This Mean?** |
| 0 - 27 | If your site scored in this range, you scored poorly. This means that your site is not (or barely) accessible to your users. Please check your individual score breakdowns so you can see where you can improve.|
| 28 - 43 | If your site scored in this range, you scored in the middle. This means your site is somewhat accessible to your users. Please check your individual score breakdowns so you can see where you can improve.|
| 44 - 56 | If your site scored in this range, your score was great! This means your site is mostly or completely accessible to your users. Please check your individual score breakdowns so you can see where you can improve.|

## Understanding Your Individual Breakdowns

### Navigation

| **Score Range** | **What Does This Mean?** |
| 0 - 6| A score in this range indicates your website scored poorly in terms of navigation. |
| 7 - 10 | A score in this range indicates your website scored moderately in terms of navigation.|
| 11 - 14| A score in this range indicates your website scored well in terms of navigation.|

#### Next Steps

If you did not score high in this section, this means that users will find it hard to find information and content they need on your site. Take a look at the way your navigation bar is set up (or if you don't have one, add one!). Make sure links are organized in sections and would allow a user to quickly find what they need.

You might find it useful to conduct a short research study to see what users look for in your website primarily and then organize your website based on that. 

Additionally, make sure pages are ordered sequentially and that users are able to backtrace if needed.

### Usability

| **Score Range** | **What Does This Mean?** |
| 0 - 6| A score in this range indicates your website scored poorly in terms of usability. |
| 7 - 10 | A score in this range indicates your website scored moderately in terms of usability.|
| 11 - 14| A score in this range indicates your website scored well in terms of usability.|

#### Next Steps

If you did not score high in this section, this means that users are unable to use your site affectively. You may need to do some site maintenance.

Check to make sure all links and forms on your website are working and that the titles are descriptive. Additionally, can someone figure out what your site is immediately? If not, then you may have to restructure your site to make it easy for users to identify the purpose or mission of your organization.

Proper grammar and punctuation rules are key. Abbreviations should be spelled out the first time they are referenced.

Lastly, make sure your site can be used by a keyboard if a mouse is not available.

### Layout

| **Score Range** | **What Does This Mean?** |
| 0 - 6| A score in this range indicates your website scored poorly in terms of layout. |
| 7 - 10 | A score in this range indicates your website scored moderately in terms of layout.|
| 11 - 14| A score in this range indicates your website scored well in terms of layout.|

#### Next Steps

If you did not score high in this section, this means that your website has a layout that is overwhelming or confusing to users. 

It is essential that information is broken up into sections and having headings/subheadings. Users will want to find the section that pertains to them instead of searching through large chunks of plain text.

Additionally, your website should have a layout that remains consistent from page to page. Users do not want to be surprised or do not want to think they have been taken to a different website. Consistency is key and should be applied to all features.

Lastly, colors should be labeled.

### Design

| **Score Range** | **What Does This Mean?** |
| 0 - 6| A score in this range indicates your website scored poorly in terms of design. |
| 7 - 10 | A score in this range indicates your website scored moderately in terms of design.|
| 11 - 14| A score in this range indicates your website scored well in terms of design.|

#### Next Steps

If you did not score high in this section, this means that the design of your site needs to be updated.

Make sure that all images have alt tags/attributes. It is also crucial that the design of your site remains consistent across all forms. It's a good idea to have a theme on your website. This give you a framework for how your site will look.

It's important to make sure your site doesn't have text everywhere. Break text into sections with the appropriate headings. Update your site periodically. 

Lastly, make sure your videos have transcripts and captions available.
