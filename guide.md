## How To Evaluate Your Website Correctly

In the spreadsheet/tool, you will notice that there are four sections: Navigation, Usability, Layout, and Design. By narrowing down on these sections, users are able to figure out what may need work with their website (and what doesn't!).

This guide is broken up by the four sections and will go through each statement to help you identify what to look for so you can rank each statement correctly.

### Navigation

|Statement/Question| What To Look For| What Inputs Will This Take?|
|The website makes use of a navigation bar.| Look at either the side or the top of the website. Does this website have tabs or a drop down menu that gives you access to more options? If a website doesn't have a navigation tool, then all their information will be listed on that one main page or they will have links listed to other pages but no central way to find other pages.| 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
|If you click on the navigation bar, options are displayed in an orderly fashion.| When you hover or click on a tab in the navigation bar, are the options listed in order or under sections? Or is the information just listed in an order that has no significance?| 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
|The options listed in the nav bar help you find what you are looking for.| Are you able to easily find what you're looking for? Or do you find yourself confused by all the options? Do the sections in the navigation bar actually pertain to the content or are the titles useless? |0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|					
|On the current page, there is an option to move to the next page.| When you are on a page on the website, look at the bottom or top of the section. Is there an option to move to the next page in the sequence? Usually, you will see a highlighted piece of text that will contain a link to the next page. |0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|					
|If you click the "back" button, you go immediately to the page you were on.| This will depend on the browser that you are using, but click the "back" button that is usually listed by the website link at the top of your browser. When you are taken back a page, do you end up immediately at the page you were at before or do you end up somewhere else? This is important because if users want to retrace their steps, they should be able to do so in a sequential manner. |0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|					
|There is a search bar and it is useful when looking for information.| Search bars may be located at the top of the website but some are located on the bottom. Try searching for something on the site. Do the search results actually help you find what you are looking for or are the results skewed? Do results pop up at all? |0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|					
|Overall, it is easy to find what you are looking for on the site.| If you were to find a particular product or if you were to find more information about something on the site, would you be able to easily find it? Or would you find yourself randomly clicking through the pages? |0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
