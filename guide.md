## How To Evaluate Your Website Correctly

In the spreadsheet/tool, you will notice that there are four sections: Navigation, Usability, Layout, and Design. By narrowing down on these sections, users are able to figure out what may need work with their website (and what doesn't!).

This guide is broken up by the four sections and will go through each statement to help you identify what to look for so you can rank each statement correctly.

### Navigation

|**Statement/Question**| **What To Look For**| **What Inputs Will This Take?**|
|The website makes use of a navigation bar.| Look at either the side or the top of the website. Does this website have tabs or a drop down menu that gives you access to more options? If a website doesn't have a navigation tool, then all their information will be listed on that one main page or they will have links listed to other pages but no central way to find other pages.| 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
|If you click on the navigation bar, options are displayed in an orderly fashion.| When you hover or click on a tab in the navigation bar, are the options listed in order or under sections? Or is the information just listed in an order that has no significance?| 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
|The options listed in the nav bar help you find what you are looking for.| Are you able to easily find what you're looking for? Or do you find yourself confused by all the options? Do the sections in the navigation bar actually pertain to the content or are the titles useless? |0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|					
|On the current page, there is an option to move to the next page.| When you are on a page on the website, look at the bottom or top of the section. Is there an option to move to the next page in the sequence? Usually, you will see a highlighted piece of text that will contain a link to the next page. |0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|					
|If you click the "back" button, you go immediately to the page you were on.| This will depend on the browser that you are using, but click the "back" button that is usually listed by the website link at the top of your browser. When you are taken back a page, do you end up immediately at the page you were at before or do you end up somewhere else? This is important because if users want to retrace their steps, they should be able to do so in a sequential manner. |0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|					
|There is a search bar and it is useful when looking for information.| Search bars may be located at the top of the website but some are located on the bottom. Try searching for something on the site. Do the search results actually help you find what you are looking for or are the results skewed? Do results pop up at all? |0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|					
|Overall, it is easy to find what you are looking for on the site.| If you were to find a particular product or if you were to find more information about something on the site, would you be able to easily find it? Or would you find yourself randomly clicking through the pages? |0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|		

## Usability

|**Statement/Question**| **What To Look For**| **What Inputs Will This Take?**|
|All links on the website are working and direct you to a useful site.| Click on links that are provided for you on the website (this can include page links or links in the navigation bar). Are you directed to the site you expect to be directed to? Or is the link broken? Check if the link directs you to a site that isn't what you expect to be directed to.| 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|				
|The link titles are descriptive.| You should be able to tell where you will be going by the title of the link (what you click on). If you can't tell by the link title itself, then you don't know where you're going. | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|					
|You can immediately tell what the website is about from the home page.| Is it clear what the website is about or what service is being provided on the site? Think about when you first accessed the site. Did you feel overwhelmed and confused? Or did you immediately know what the site was about? | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|						
|The website clearly states their mission or purpose statement.| Can you easily find the mission statement or purpose of the site? This may not be listed on the main home page, but you should be able to find it in another page. This may be under the "About" page or "More Info" section. Either way, you should be able to find it easily. | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
|You can use the up/down arrows or your keyboard to navigate the site.| Can you avoid using a mouse to navigate the site? Using keyboard features should still provide you with the same access as using a mouse. | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
|Any abbreviations listed are explained.| Any abbreviations or acronyms should be explained in the first use. On each page, if an acronym or abbreviation is used, it should be spelled out completely in its first use. This applies to ALL pages of a website, not just the home page. | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|	
|All forms (contact, survey, etc.) work and are displayed appropriately.| If there is a form to submit information, does this form work or is your information not being collected? If this is your website, run several tests with test data. If this is not your site, check with the owners of the site to ensure your information is going through. | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|		

## Layout

|**Statement/Question**| **What To Look For**| **What Inputs Will This Take?**|
|Headings and subheadings are displayed on the website.| There should be text hierarchies present. Can you differentiate between sections of text? Are there titles available that describe what will be discussed in the following paragraph(s)? | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
|The website uses a limited amount of fonts.| The website should be using only a certain number of fonts. Are there multiple fonts being displayed on the website? Or does the website use only a particular font or two? | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
|It is easy to read content on the website.| Can you easily scan the information on the website and figure out the main idea or summary? Or is the information scattered around, inconsistent in style, and distracting? Easy to read content means you are able to figure out what the site is about in the snap of a finger. | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
|Images/videos are placed in a way that do not distract from main content.|	The site should not be littered with random images and audio content. Images should add to the information on the site, not take away from it. Additionally, unless the site/page is focused on the image, the image should not be in the center. | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|	
|If an image/graph has colors, their representations are labeled.| Because some users may be colorblind, it is important to label colors on a graph so that those users are able to distinguish between groups or patterns. Check out the graphs on the site. If you removed the color, would you still be able to interpret the graph the same? | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|		
|The layout remains consistent when you navigate from page to page.| This is important because users don't want new patterns or layouts thrown at them every single time they access a different portion of the website. When you access a different page, does the layout (headings, subheadings, font, size, etc.) stay relatively the same? | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
|Graphs and tables have all necessary features.| Check to see if graphs include titles, labels, captions, keys, and interpretations. If they do not, then users will not be able to understand them. | 0 (no), 1 (maybe/neutral), 2 (yes)|
